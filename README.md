Hello! This is a functioning Task Tracker

How to run:
(make sure you installed node.js)
First:
start the server: type cd backend/server, after pressing enter, type npm run dev then press enter

Second: 
Start the frontend page: Open another terminal and type cd frontend, upon pressing enter, type npm run dev then press enter

for testing purposes here is a test account:
username: Test3
password: Test456

It was fun and at the same time challenging especially since I only worked frontend last semester. But this was a learning opportunity.
